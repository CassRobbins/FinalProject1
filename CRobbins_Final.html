      <h1><center>The Aedra and Daedra</center></h1>
  <p>Every D&D campaign needs Gods and Goddesses in order for Clerics or Paladins to even function. Thankfully, the Elder Scrolls has provided an expansive pantheon of expressive Gods to really assist Dungeon Masters in getting the right flair for their players. But what exactly are the Aedra and Daedra?</p>
  <h3>Aedra</h3>
  <p>The Aedra, also known as The Nine Divines, are the most revered of the Gods in all of Tamriel (the continent where Skyrim is set) They have also been referred to as The Eight Divines and the One, or simply the Eight Divines. Talos remains a topic of discussion, as Nords believe he ascended to Godhood while the Altmer insist he was merely a man.</p>
  <a href="aedra.html"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elderscrolls/images/9/9d/Nine_Divines_Stained_Glass.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20161014203324" alt="stained glass aedra" height=20% width=100%></a>
  <p style=font-size:10px;>A depiction of the Nine Divines as shown in the Temple of the Divines</p>
  <h4>The Divines Consist of:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>|LG| Akatosh | The dragon god of time.</li>
    <li>|TN| Arkay | God of the cycle of life and death.</li>
    <li>|CG| Dibella | Goddess of beauty and love.</li>
    <li>|LN| Julianos | God of Wisdom and logic.</li>
    <li>|CG| Kynareth | Goddess of air, wind, sky and the elements.</li>
    <li>|CN| Mara | Goddess of love and compassion.</li>
    <li>|LN| Stendaar | God of mercy, justice, charity and righteous rule.</li>
    <li>|LG| Talos | God of might, honor, law and man. The Conqueror God.</li>
    <li>|TN| Zenithar | God of work, commerce, and trade.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now, you may notice these labels such as “LG” listed above. These are the alignments of these Gods. These alignments are to determine the moral compass of every creature in Dungeons & Dragons, including the player themselves. They are as follows:</p>
  <h4>Horizontally is their opinion of the law and authority: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Lawful</li>
    <ul>
      <li>They greatly value upholding the law</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Neutral</li>
    <ul>
      <li>They don’t care about the law, but also don’t care to actively rebel against it. These individuals can easily be swayed.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Chaotic</li>
    <ul>
      <li>They actively disregard the law, the rebels of society.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h4>Vertically is their personal sense of morals:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Good</li>
    <ul>
      <li>These are individuals that care deeply about the wellbeing of others, to the degree of them willing to sacrifice themselves if it means preserving the life of another. They are altruistic and fair.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Neutral</li>
    <ul>
      <li>They disagree with killing the innocent, but also don’t have the drive to sacrifice themselves to protect. Most of their commitment comes from personal relationships, they don’t have an internal want to be heroic.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Evil</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Those who actively seek to harm or control others, and have no issues with taking the life of another person.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>These alignments become more important for the Daedra, as there are many more of them and more broad characters among them. Notice how none of the divines fall under the evil alignment?</p>

  <h3>Daedra</h3>
  <p>Daedra is a very broad term that describes every creature born in the Realm of Oblivion (Oblivion being very similar to Hell.) Daedric Princes are the most powerful of all Daedra, having godlike powers and as such are worshipped like gods.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>|NG| Azura | A Prince who maintains/draws power from the balance of night and day, light and dark.</li>
    <li>|CE| Boethiah | The Prince of deceit, secrecy, conspiracy, treason, and unlawful overthrow of authority.</li>
    <li>|CN| Clavicus Vile | The Prince of deals, pacts, power, bargains, and serenity through wish fulfillment.</li>
    <li>|LE| Hermaeus Mora | The formless Daedric Prince of knowledge and memory.</li>
    <li>|TN| Hircine | The Prince of the hunt, commonly tied to werewolves.</li>
    <li>|LN| Jyggalag | The Prince of logical order and deduction, upholds strict order above all else. Was transformed into Sheogorath.</li>
    <li>|TN| Malacath | The protector of the ostracized and spurned, giving them a chance at finding glory.</li>
    <li>|NE| Mehrunes Dagon | The Prince of destruction, violence, energy, and mortal ambition.</li>
    <li>|CE| Mephala | The Prince of unknown plots and obfuscation, a master manipulator, a sower of discord.</li>
    <li>|LN| Meridia | The Prince of the energies of all living things, enemy of the undead and all who disrupt the flow of life.</li>
    <li>|CE| Molag Bal   The Prince of domination and enslavement, seeks to ensnare souls within his domain.</li>
    <li>|TN| Namira | The Prince of all things considered repulsive, the cannibal prince.</li>
    <li>|CN| Nocturnal | The Prince of the night and darkness. Mother of the Nightengales.</li>
    <li>|LN| Peryite | The Daedric Prince of Pestilence, desires order in his domain.</li>
    <li>|CG| Sanguine | The Prince of hedonism, debauchery, and the further indulgences of one's darker nature.</li>
    <li>|CN| Sheogorath | The infamous Prince of Madness, whose motives are unknowable. Previously known as Jyggalag.</li>
    <li>|NE| Vaermina | The Prince of dreams and nightmares, a deliverer of evil omens and dark portents.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Daedra worship is frowned upon in Skyrim, as many of its citizens believe all Daedra to be wholly evil. But as you can see by their alignments, not all of them are evil. In fact, three of them are worshipped by the dark elves to the East. Azura, Boethiah and Mephala - These are their “Three Good Daedra.” There are also four Daedra they recognize as being worse than the rest: Molag Bal, Mehrunes Dagon, Malacath, and Sheogorath. To the Dunmer, these are noted under the House of Reclamations and the House of Troubles. Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala are believed to be the descendants of the now missing or deceased Tribunal; Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil.</p>
